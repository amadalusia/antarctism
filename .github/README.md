###### welcome to my dotfiles, made with the assisted efforts or reading documentation... or stealing.

###### this flake was made with [misterio77's flake template](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-starter-config)

###### however I have been planning on making my own flake using flake-parts, which i havent gotten around to fully completing yet.
